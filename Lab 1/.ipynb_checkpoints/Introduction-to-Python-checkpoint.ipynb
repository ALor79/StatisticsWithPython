Each set of lab exercises is worth 5% of your final grade (total 30%). The exercises will be posted at least one week before the lab session and you will have until the following Monday to complete the exercises.

A function is an input-output relationship, e.g. $f(x) = x^2$, if we use the input $x = 2$, we get an output $4$, which of course is $2^2$. Similarly, in programming, we specify a set of inputs and commands to be carried of on those inputs and the function returns a set of outputs. In Python, a function is defined using `def`. The function is given a name and its inputs are specified in round brackets after the function name. Typically, a function must have a return statement, which specifies the function output. Below we create a function `f`, which returns the input `x` to the power of 2:"
